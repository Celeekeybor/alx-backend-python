All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
All your files should end with a new line
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.x)
All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
